## Development Environment

This project uses **DDEV** for local development. DDEV provides a consistent, containerized development environment that works across different operating systems.

## robo

We switched to the robo command so we could remove BLT as it's no longer supported. Some of the commands have been revised as well.

| Command          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Testing

### Cypress Testing

This project includes Cypress for end-to-end testing. The Cypress configuration is located in `tests/cypress/`.

#### Configuring the Base URL

The base URL for testing is configured in `tests/cypress/cypress.config.js`. By default, it's set to the local DDEV environment.

**Available URLs for testing:**
- **Local DDEV**: `https://cyberteam-drupal.ddev.site` (default)
- **Access Match**: `https://accessmatch.ddev.site`
- **CCMNet**: `https://ccmnet.ddev.site`
- **ConnectCI**: `https://connectci.ddev.site`
- **CRCT**: `https://crct.ddev.site`
- **Campus Champions**: `https://campuschampions.ddev.site`
- **COCO**: `https://coco.ddev.site`
- **Great Plains**: `https://greatplains.ddev.site`
- **KYCT**: `https://kyct.ddev.site`
- **NECT**: `https://nect.ddev.site`
- **OnDemand**: `https://ondemand.ddev.site`

#### Running Cypress Tests

1. **Navigate to the Cypress directory:**
   ```bash
   cd tests/cypress
   ```

2. **Run with a specific URL using environment variable:**
   ```bash
   # Test accessmatch domain
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://accessmatch.ddev.site npm run cypress:run
   
   # Test crct domain
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://crct.ddev.site npm run cypress:open
   
   # Test production (if available)
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://your-production-site.com npm run cypress:run
   ```

#### Using Robo for Cypress

You can also run Cypress tests using the robo command:
```bash
vendor/bin/robo cypress [test_name]
```

For example:
- `vendor/bin/robo cypress` - Runs tests on accessmatch1
- `vendor/bin/robo cypress crct` - Runs tests on crct domain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) installed on your local machine
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required by DDEV)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/necyberteam/cyberteam_drupal.git
   cd cyberteam_drupal
   ```

2. **Start DDEV and setup the site:**
   ```bash
   vendor/bin/robo ddevsetup [GITHUB_TOKEN] [AMP_UID]
   ```
   
   Or setup manually:
   ```bash
   ddev start
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo gh:pulldb
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo gh:pullfiles
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo did
   ```

3. **Access the site:**
   - Main site: https://cyberteam-drupal.ddev.site
   - All configured domains:
     - https://accessmatch.ddev.site
     - https://ccmnet.ddev.site
     - https://connectci.ddev.site
     - https://crct.ddev.site
     - https://campuschampions.ddev.site
     - https://coco.ddev.site
     - https://greatplains.ddev.site
     - https://kyct.ddev.site
     - https://nect.ddev.site
     - https://ondemand.ddev.site

## Codespaces

This repository is setup to run in GitHub Codespaces with DDEV. If you are starting from scratch it'll take a little over 15 minutes to run through the setup script. The script will fully start DDEV and install the site. You will need to set two codespaces secrets in your personal github settings under codespaces located at: https://github.com/settings/codespaces

- AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO
- AMP_UID

The ```AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO``` secret will have a github token that has access to the cyberteam repositories with full repo control and ```AMP_UID``` is the user id of your user on the website. You can default to uid 1 if you don't have or know your user id.

Optionally, you can setup two other secrets to automatically login to terminus to connect to Pantheon. You can always run the command to login after install as well. These are the secrets to have the login setup for you:

- AMP_TERMINUS_EMAIL
- AMP_TERMINUS_TOKEN

The email secret is the email you use with pantheon and the token can be setup under your settings within your pantheon account.

### Github CLI

You can create, open, and ssh into your codespaces using Github CLI, see [install instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) to install on your local system. Once installed check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-with-github-cli) for commands you can use. You can authorize Github CLI by running the following command:

```gh auth login```
