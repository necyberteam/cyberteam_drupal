# Connect.CI Portal

**A single Drupal platform powering the web presence of 13+ cyberinfrastructure communities.**

Connect.CI is a web-based platform for collaboration across the national research computing ecosystem. Originally built to manage project workflows for regional cyberteams, it has grown into a comprehensive community infrastructure hosting thirteen community sites — including ACCESS Support, the Campus Champions program, the Cyberinfrastructure Community-wide Mentorship Network (CCMNet), and the Open OnDemand Community Hub — on a single shared codebase. Each program selectively enables and configures a common set of features while sharing one user base, knowledge base, and tag taxonomy, so a member's profile, skills, and contributions persist as they move between communities.

A research paper describing the platform and its operational model appeared at PEARC '26 — see [Citation](#citation) below.

## What it does

The platform provides a common set of features that each community selectively enables and configures:

- **People directories** — searchable per-community directories with skills, interests, and expertise tagging (surfaced on ACCESS Support as the CSSN directory).
- **Affinity groups** — topical communities with coordinators, goals, meeting notes, announcements, and mailing lists.
- **Events** — recurring events with registration, waitlists, surveys, reminders, and archived recordings.
- **Knowledge base** — curated tutorials and documentation with community voting and Ask.CI Q&A integration.
- **Mentorship & matchmaking** — structured mentor/mentee engagements with goal setting and progress tracking (CCMNet, ACCESS MATCH, Campus Champions AI Mentorship).
- **Recognition** — a cross-community "community persona," badges, and an Open OnDemand Contributor Wall.
- **Appverse** — a GitHub-synchronized catalog of Open OnDemand application configurations with an editorial workflow.
- **AI integration** — a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) support chatbot, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for live platform data, and JSON/plain-text content APIs.
- **Federated identity** — CILogon single sign-on across all communities.

Communities served include ACCESS Support, the Campus Champions program, CCMNet, the Open OnDemand Community Hub, the Pennsylvania Science DMZ, and several regional cyberteam sites (originating with the Northeast Cyberteam).

## Architecture

The platform is a Drupal 10 application built around the **Domain** module, which lets one codebase present many sites. Domain-specific theming, configuration, and content are layered on top of shared subsystems.

Custom functionality is organized into several groups:

**The `access` module suite** ([connectci-platform/access](https://github.com/connectci-platform/access)) — 18 focused submodules implementing most of the community subsystems:
`access_affinitygroup`, `access_events`, `access_badges`, `access_news`, `access_outages`, `access_cilink`, `access_shortcodes`, `access_misc`, `access_entity_copy`, `access_match_engagement`, `access_content_api`, `access_llm`, `ccmnet` (mentorship), `cssn` (directory), `ondemand`, `ticketing`, `user_profiles`, and `recurring_events_surveys`.

**Portal-level modules** (in this repository) — cross-cutting concerns maintained directly in the portal:
`ood_software` (Appverse/OnDemand application catalog), `ood_contributions`, `openid_connect_cilogon_client` (federated SSO), `campuschampions`, and `viewsoverride`.

**Shared and external modules** — some functionality is packaged as standalone repositories (see [Repository layout](#repository-layout)): CiDeR resource ingestion (`operations_cider`), seamless CILogon (`drupal_seamless_cilogon`), infrastructure news (`infrastructure_news`), search-API helpers (`webform_submission_search_api`), and development fixtures (`amp_dev`).

**Themes** — four custom themes drive presentation:

- **`ood`** and **`pascience`** (in this repository) — the OpenOnDemand-community and PA-ScienceDMZ themes.
- **[connectci-platform/aspTheme](https://github.com/connectci-platform/aspTheme)** — the primary Tailwind-based theme used by ACCESS Support and most domains.
- **[connectci-platform/campus-champions-theme](https://github.com/connectci-platform/campus-champions-theme)** — the Campus Champions community theme.

### Tech stack

- **Drupal 10.6** / PHP 8.3
- **Domain** module for multi-site-from-one-codebase
- **Search API** for faceted search across events, resources, and the professional directory
- **Recurring Events** for the events subsystem
- **CILogon / OpenID Connect** for federated SSO
- **Feeds** for automated ingestion from the ACCESS CiDeR resource repository
- **Tailwind CSS** in the custom themes
- **DDEV** for local development; **Pantheon** for hosting; **Cypress** for end-to-end testing

---

## Repository layout

The bulk of the custom code is in **this repository** (portal-level modules, the `ood` and `pascience` themes, all site configuration, build and deploy tooling). Several subsystems are maintained as standalone repositories and assembled at build time via Composer:

| Repository | Contents | Owner |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **connectci-platform/portal** (this repo) | Drupal site, portal-level modules, `ood`/`pascience` themes, config, tooling | connectci-platform |
| [connectci-platform/access](https://github.com/connectci-platform/access) | The `access` module suite — 18 community subsystems | connectci-platform |
| [connectci-platform/aspTheme](https://github.com/connectci-platform/aspTheme) | Primary Tailwind theme | connectci-platform |
| [connectci-platform/campus-champions-theme](https://github.com/connectci-platform/campus-champions-theme) | Campus Champions theme | connectci-platform |
| [connectci-platform/amp_dev](https://github.com/connectci-platform/amp_dev) | Development/data fixtures | connectci-platform |
| [connectci-platform/webform_submission_search_api](https://github.com/connectci-platform/webform_submission_search_api) | Search API helper module | connectci-platform |
| [access-ci-org/drupal_seamless_cilogon](https://github.com/access-ci-org/drupal_seamless_cilogon) | Seamless CILogon (shared ACCESS infrastructure) | access-ci-org |
| [access-ci-org/infrastructure_news](https://github.com/access-ci-org/infrastructure_news) | Infrastructure news (shared ACCESS infrastructure) | access-ci-org |
| [connectci-platform/operations_cider](https://github.com/connectci-platform/operations_cider) | Feed integration that ingests HPC resource data from the ACCESS Operations CiDeR API | connectci-platform |

Third-party dependencies (e.g. [UCBoulder/facets_honeypot](https://github.com/UCBoulder/facets_honeypot)) and all contributed Drupal modules are pulled via Composer and are not vendored here.

# Developer guide

## Development Environment

This project uses **DDEV** for local development. DDEV provides a consistent, containerized development environment that works across different operating systems.

## robo

We switched to the robo command so we could remove BLT as it's no longer supported. Some of the commands have been revised as well.

| Command          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Testing

### Cypress Testing

This project includes Cypress for end-to-end testing. The Cypress configuration is located in `tests/cypress/`.

#### Configuring the Base URL

The base URL for testing is configured in `tests/cypress/cypress.config.js`. By default, it's set to the local DDEV environment.

**Available URLs for testing:**
- **Local DDEV**: `https://cyberteam-drupal.ddev.site` (default)
- **Access Match**: `https://accessmatch.ddev.site`
- **CCMNet**: `https://ccmnet.ddev.site`
- **ConnectCI**: `https://connectci.ddev.site`
- **CRCT**: `https://crct.ddev.site`
- **Campus Champions**: `https://campuschampions.ddev.site`
- **COCO**: `https://coco.ddev.site`
- **Great Plains**: `https://greatplains.ddev.site`
- **KYCT**: `https://kyct.ddev.site`
- **NECT**: `https://nect.ddev.site`
- **OnDemand**: `https://ondemand.ddev.site`

#### Running Cypress Tests

1. **Navigate to the Cypress directory:**
   ```bash
   cd tests/cypress
   ```

2. **Run with a specific URL using environment variable:**
   ```bash
   # Test accessmatch domain
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://accessmatch.ddev.site npm run cypress:run

   # Test crct domain
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://crct.ddev.site npm run cypress:open

   # Test production (if available)
   CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://your-production-site.com npm run cypress:run
   ```

#### Using Robo for Cypress

You can also run Cypress tests using the robo command:
```bash
vendor/bin/robo cypress [test_name]
```

For example:
- `vendor/bin/robo cypress` - Runs tests on accessmatch1
- `vendor/bin/robo cypress crct` - Runs tests on crct domain

### Accessibility Testing with Axe

This project includes automated accessibility testing using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and [cypress-axe](https://github.com/component-driven/cypress-axe).

#### Running Accessibility Tests

Accessibility tests are located in `tests/cypress/cypress/e2e/axe/` and test key pages across the site for WCAG compliance.

**Local Testing:**
```bash
cd tests/cypress
# Run all accessibility tests (default domain: accessmatch)
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://accessmatch.ddev.site npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/axe/**/*.js"

# Or test on a different domain
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://connectci.ddev.site npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/axe/**/*.js"
```

**GitHub Actions:**
The accessibility tests run automatically when you include `#a11y` in your:
- Commit message
- Pull request title
- Pull request body

Example commit: `git commit -m "Fix navigation aria-labels #a11y"`

#### Accessibility Reports

When tests run, detailed HTML and CSV reports are generated in `tests/cypress/cypress-a11y-reports/`:
- **summary.html** - Overview of all violations grouped by severity
- **Individual HTML reports** - Detailed breakdown for each tested page
- **CSV files** - Violation data for further analysis

**In CI/CD**, reports are:
1. Uploaded to the [cypress-a11y repository](https://connectci-platform.github.io/cypress-a11y/) at `reports/YYYYMMDD/BRANCH_NAME/RUN_ID/summary.html`
2. Available as GitHub Actions artifacts (downloadable for 90 days)
3. Linked in the GitHub Actions run summary
4. Posted to Slack (#cypress-git-notifications) with direct links

#### Controlling Test Failures

By default, accessibility tests **report violations but do not fail**. This allows you to track and fix issues progressively.

To make tests fail on specific severity levels, set the `CYPRESS_A11Y_FAIL_ON` environment variable:

```bash
# Fail on critical issues only
CYPRESS_A11Y_FAIL_ON=critical npm run cypress:run

# Fail on serious and critical issues
CYPRESS_A11Y_FAIL_ON=serious,critical npm run cypress:run
```

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical** - Serious impact on accessibility, must be fixed
- **Serious** - Significant barrier for some users
- **Moderate** - Noticeable issue but not blocking
- **Minor** - Small improvements that enhance accessibility

#### Custom Accessibility Helper

The project includes a custom `cy.a11yCheckWithReport()` command that:
- Runs axe-core analysis on the current page
- Generates detailed HTML and CSV reports
- Logs violation counts by severity
- Optionally fails tests based on severity thresholds

**Example usage:**
```javascript
describe('My Page Accessibility', () => {
  it('should be accessible', () => {
    cy.visit('/my-page');
    cy.injectAxe();
    cy.a11yCheckWithReport();
  });
});
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) installed on your local machine
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required by DDEV)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/connectci-platform/portal.git
   cd portal
   ```

2. **Start DDEV and setup the site:**
   ```bash
   vendor/bin/robo ddevsetup [GITHUB_TOKEN] [AMP_UID]
   ```

   Or setup manually:
   ```bash
   ddev start
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo gh:pulldb
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo gh:pullfiles
   ddev exec vendor/bin/robo did
   ```

3. **Access the site:**
   - Main site: https://cyberteam-drupal.ddev.site
   - All configured domains:
     - https://accessmatch.ddev.site
     - https://ccmnet.ddev.site
     - https://connectci.ddev.site
     - https://crct.ddev.site
     - https://campuschampions.ddev.site
     - https://coco.ddev.site
     - https://greatplains.ddev.site
     - https://kyct.ddev.site
     - https://nect.ddev.site
     - https://ondemand.ddev.site

## Codespaces

This repository is setup to run in GitHub Codespaces with DDEV. If you are starting from scratch it'll take a little over 15 minutes to run through the setup script. The script will fully start DDEV and install the site. You will need to set two codespaces secrets in your personal github settings under codespaces located at: https://github.com/settings/codespaces

- AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO
- AMP_UID

The ```AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO``` secret will have a github token that has access to the cyberteam repositories with full repo control and ```AMP_UID``` is the user id of your user on the website. You can default to uid 1 if you don't have or know your user id.

Optionally, you can setup two other secrets to automatically login to terminus to connect to Pantheon. You can always run the command to login after install as well. These are the secrets to have the login setup for you:

- AMP_TERMINUS_EMAIL
- AMP_TERMINUS_TOKEN

The email secret is the email you use with pantheon and the token can be setup under your settings within your pantheon account.

### Github CLI

You can create, open, and ssh into your codespaces using Github CLI, see [install instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) to install on your local system. Once installed check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-with-github-cli) for commands you can use. You can authorize Github CLI by running the following command:

```gh auth login```
