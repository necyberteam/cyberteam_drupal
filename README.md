## robo

We switched to the robo command so we could remove BLT as it's no longer supported. Some of the commands have been revised as well.

## Codespaces

This repository is setup to run in codespaces. If you are starting from scratch it'll take a little over 15 minutes to run through the setup script. The script will fully start lando and install the site. You will need to set two codespaces secrets in your personal github settings under codespaces located at: https://github.com/settings/codespaces

- AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO
- AMP_UID

The ```AMP_GH_TOKEN_REPO``` secret will have a github token that has access to the cyberteam repositories with full repo control and ```AMP_UID``` is the user id of your user on the website. You can default to uid 1 if you don't have or know your user id.

Optionally, you can setup two other secrets to automatically login to terminus to connect to Panthon. You can always run the command to login after install as well. These are the secrets to have the login setup for you:

- AMP_TERMINUS_EMAIL
- AMP_TERMINUS_TOKEN

The email secret is the email you use with pantheon and the token can be setup under your settings within your pantheon account.

When starting lando run the ```blt amp:start``` command as that will also set your composer github key with the latest GITHUB_TOKEN variable set by codespaces.

### Github CLI

You can create, open, and ssh into your codespaces using Github CLI, see [install instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) to install on your local system. Once installed check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-with-github-cli) for commands you can use. You can authorize Github CLI by running the following command:

```gh auth login```
