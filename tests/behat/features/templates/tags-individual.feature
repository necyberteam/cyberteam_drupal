Feature: test individual tags page
  To test an individual tag
  While either authenticated or not
  I can verify tag components appear as expected.
  Included in test:
   - Page title is the tagâ€™s name
   - CILinks, category, skill level,
   - Can create a project or affinity group with a tag and the tag will appear
     on the page and can be followed
  TODO 8/4/23:
    - from 1.0 spreadsheet: Mentors/Regional Facilitators/Facilitators/RCFs/RSEs/CISEs
      with the tag (either in skills or interests; this section should display
      mentors and regional facilitators from all regions).
    - Ask.ci topics/posts with the tag (Term from Ask.CI), Topic Title (each item
      links to its topic in ask.ci, links should open in a new tab)
