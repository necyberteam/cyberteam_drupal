Feature: The Announcements Page displays a title "Announcements" and lists
announcements with titles and "Read more" buttons linking to their respective stories.
The filter by Affinity Group works as expected, and a "Posting Announcement" box appears
under the filter. For adding announcements, there's an "Add Announcement" button that directs
users to a form, with anonymous users required to log in first.

  Scenario: Unauthenticated user tests the Announcements Page
    Given I am not logged in
    When I go to "/announcements"
    Then I should see "Announcements"
    Then I should see "ACCESS Pegasus â€“ Hosted Workflow Environment with HTCondor Annex"
    Then I should see "9/28/2022"
    Then I should see "Pegasus is now part of the ACCESS"
    Then I should see "On September 1st, the XSEDE project transitioned"
    Then I should see "Read more"
    Then I should see "Posting Announcements"
    Then I should see "Add Announcement"
    When I select "Delta" from "field_affinity_group_target_id"
    When I press "edit-submit-access-news--2"
    And I wait 10 seconds
    Then I should see "NCSA DELTA to Enter Production"
    When I click "Add Announcement"
    Then I should be on "/user/login?destination=/node/add/access_news"
