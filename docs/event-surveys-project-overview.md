# Event Registration Surveys - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

We are developing an integrated survey system for our event registration platform that will allow event organizers to easily collect feedback from attendees before and after events. This feature will streamline the feedback collection process while providing valuable insights to improve future events.

## The Problem

Currently, event organizers who want to gather attendee feedback must:
- Manually create separate survey forms
- Manually send survey links to registrants
- Track responses across multiple systems
- Correlate survey data with registration information

This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in low response rates due to poor timing and follow-up.

## The Solution

An integrated survey system that automatically:
- **Attaches surveys to events** during the creation process
- **Distributes surveys** via email at optimal times (before/after events)
- **Tracks responses** and sends reminders to non-respondents
- **Aggregates results** with event and registration context
- **Provides templates** to reduce setup time and ensure quality

## Key Features

### 1. Template-Based Survey Creation
- **Pre-built templates** for common survey types (pre-event expectations, post-event feedback, skills assessments)
- **Personal template library** where users can save customized surveys for reuse
- **Template sharing** within organizations to promote best practices
- **One-click customization** to modify templates for specific events

### 2. Automated Distribution & Follow-up
- **Smart timing** - surveys sent X days before/after events based on organizer preferences
- **Personalized emails** with branded templates and clear calls-to-action
- **Automatic reminders** for incomplete surveys
- **Secure access** via tokenized links tied to specific registrations

### 3. Integrated Results & Analytics
- **Real-time dashboards** showing response rates and key metrics
- **Aggregate reporting** across questions and respondents
- **Data export** capabilities for further analysis
- **Response tracking** linked to attendee profiles

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- **Seamless integration** with existing event creation workflow
- **Preview functionality** to test surveys before deployment
- **Mobile-responsive** survey forms for high completion rates
- **Progress indicators** and save-and-continue functionality

## User Experience

### For Event Organizers
1. **Setup** - While creating an event, simply toggle on surveys and select from template library
2. **Customize** - Preview and modify survey questions as needed, save successful versions for future use
3. **Monitor** - Track response rates and view results in real-time dashboard
4. **Analyze** - Export data and view aggregate insights to improve future events

### For Event Attendees  
1. **Receive** - Get personalized email with survey link at optimal time
2. **Complete** - Access mobile-friendly survey via secure link
3. **Continue** - Save progress and return later if needed
4. **Confirm** - Receive thank you message upon completion

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Survey Management Engine** - Handles template creation, cloning, and customization
- **Distribution System** - Manages email scheduling, sending, and reminders via queue processing  
- **Results Aggregation** - Collects and analyzes survey responses with event context
- **Template Library** - Organizes and shares survey templates across users

### Integration Points
- **Event Registration System** - Seamlessly integrates with existing event creation workflow
- **Email System** - Leverages existing email infrastructure for survey distribution
- **User Management** - Connects with existing user accounts and permissions
- **Webform Module** - Built on Drupal's robust webform foundation for flexibility

## Benefits

### For Organizations
- **Increased feedback collection** through automated, well-timed outreach
- **Improved event quality** via actionable insights from attendee feedback
- **Reduced administrative overhead** by eliminating manual survey management
- **Better attendee engagement** through professional, consistent communication

### For Event Organizers
- **Time savings** through templates and automation
- **Higher response rates** via optimal timing and follow-up

- **Email Deliverability**: Leverage existing, proven email infrastructure
- **Data Security**: Token-based access and secure submission handling
- **Integration Complexity**: Built on existing, stable webform foundation

### User Adoption Risks
- **Change Management**: Gradual rollout with extensive documentation and training
- **Learning Curve**: Intuitive interface based on familiar patterns
- **Value Demonstration**: Quick wins through improved response rates
- **Support System**: Comprehensive help documentation and user support

## Conclusion

This integrated survey system represents a significant enhancement to our event management platform, addressing a real pain point for organizers while providing valuable data to improve the attendee experience. By leveraging existing infrastructure and focusing on user-friendly automation, we can deliver a solution that provides immediate value while building the foundation for advanced analytics and insights.

The template-based approach ensures quick adoption while the personal library system creates long-term value as users develop and refine their survey strategies. This positions our platform as a comprehensive solution for event management, from registration through post-event analysis.
